Throughout Sri Sri’s initiatives and discourses runs a common message: by living universal human values, we can overcome the hatred, distress, apathy, and greed that threaten our societies and our environment. By strengthening our sense of humanity, we can achieve interfaith harmony, environmental sustainability, poverty alleviation and grassroots development.

“Non-violence, friendliness and cooperation must come to be recognized as the new norm, as hallmarks of today’s true hero. Moreover, a sense of pride must be kindled in connection with these qualities, instead of with violence and aggression.” 
– Sri Sri, March 2007</p>
